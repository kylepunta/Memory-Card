# Memory Card

A memory card game, built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **React**. This project demonstrates the use of the React useEffect hook and tests users' memory skills.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for page structure
- **CSS3** for styling and responsive design
- **React** for managing and rendering the frontend user interface

## Live Demo

## How it works

1. A deck of ten Pok√©mon cards is rendered on the user interface, along with a current score and best score displayed at the top right corner.
2. When a user clicks on a card, the deck is shuffled and rerendered. If the user has not already clicked on that particular card, the current score is incremented by one.
3. The user must try to click on all the cards without clicking on one that has already been selected. If a user clicks on a card they have already selected, the current score resets to zero and the best score is updated.
